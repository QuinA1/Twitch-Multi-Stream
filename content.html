          <h2> Twitch bans the use of Simp, Incel, and Virgin as insults </h2>
          <h3> Simp, Incel, and Virgin are now bannable words on Twitch. The main controvercey that people have comes from the use of the word simp. Simp was essentially the word that replaced the term "White Knight" or "White Knighting". Which means to protect or defend a women. While some these terms are usually used in a joking way, people have somehow turned them into insults. </h2>
